        <h1 class="takeaways">04 The Process</h1>
        <h2 class = "overview">In order to make the most informed decisions and choices throughout this capstone, I made use of the <b>Design Thinking Process.</b> </h2>
        <div class="over"><img src = "Farm Fresh Images/1_33khN9zpFCMWnF8pLqeVTQ 1.png"></div>
        <h2><b><em>Intial Ideation</em></b></h2>
 

        <h2><b><em>Primary Research</em></b></h2>
        <h2 class = "overview">For the research aspect of this capstone, I found individuals to interview through: 
            <ol>Asking if participants are interested in completing a survey</ol>
            <ol>Asking people at local gym as well as at school</ol>
            <ol>Asking people at local gym as well as at school</ol>

            Once I selected my participants, these were the interview questions that I used to guide the conversation: 
                <li>What is your fitness or health routine like; what does it entail? </li>
                <li>What is an issue that you have with your current routine, if any?</li>
                <li>How often do you work out? </li>
                <li>Do you prefer to work out alone or with a friend or a group?</li>
                <li>Do you currently use any applications or forms of technology when you work out? </li>
                <li>What is your main motivation for working out? </li>
                <li>Would you use an application that allows you to communicate with other individuals about your workout? </li>

        <h2><b><em>Research Insights</em></b></h2>
        <div class = "over"><img src = "MyFit Images/insights.png"></div>

        <h2><b><em>User Flows</em></b></h2>
        <h2 class = "overview">I then started working on my user flows in order to create a visual representation of all of the routes that a user might take through the application to achieve the specified goals. </h2>
        
        <div class = "over"><img src = "MyFit Images/userflows.png"></div>

        <h2><b><em>Low Fidelity Wireframes</em></b></h2>
        <h2 class = "overview">After creating pencil and paper sketches, I was able to apply the feedback that I got and start iterating on my low fidelity wireframes.</h2>

        <h2><b><em>Style Guide</em></b></h2>

        <h1 class="takeaways">05 Conclusion</h1>
        <h2 class = "overview">I really enjoyed working on this capstone project. It was interesting to approach this project with a proper brief and goal already being assigned. Compared to the first capstone, I felt that my design decisions were more intentional and purposeful. In terms of further iteration, I would love to expand the challenges section to include more of a social aspect. I would also like to incorporate more visual elements such as graphs and growth models as a form of motivation to the individual. </h2>
